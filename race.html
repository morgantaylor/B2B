        <h3>Strollers</h3>
        <p>We ask strollers to line up towards back of the starting line. One thing to be aware of the Shuttle Buses are Yellow School buses. There are a couple that are handicapped accessible which can accommodate strollers but sometimes there is a wait to catch the shuttle back to the start. If you have a stroller that folds it possibly can fit on the regular busses. You don’t need to register the child in the stroller unless you want them to get a finisher medal and goodie bag.</p>
