                <section class="column left clearfix">
                    <h3>Water</h3>
                    <p>There will be a water station at Justin Herman Plaza.</p>
                    <p>There is one water station along the 5K route and three water stations along the 12K route. First is approximately 2.25 miles (on Van ness near the municipal pier). The second is approximately 4.5 miles at the west end of Crissy Field. This station also serves as the third water station as runners return from the 12K, approximately 5.5 miles.</p>
                    <p>There will be water tables after the finish lines.</p>
                    <h3>Restrooms</h3>
                    <p>Portable toilets are located at the start (Justin Herman Plaza) and After Party (Marina Green).</p>
                    <h3>Strollers</h3>
                    <p>We ask strollers to line up towards back of the starting line. One thing to be aware of the Shuttle Buses are Yellow School buses. There are a couple that are handicapped accessible which can accommodate strollers but sometimes there is a wait to catch the shuttle back to the start. If you have a stroller that folds it possibly can fit on the regular buses. You don’t need to register the child in the stroller unless you want them to get a finisher medal and goodie bag.</p>
                    <h3>Changing Events</h3>
                    <p>If you accidently signed up for the wrong event or have changed your mind and want to switch events please log back into <a href="https://runsignup.com/" target="_blank">Runsignup.com</a> using the login that you created when registering for the race. From there navigate to "My Races" where you should see "Bridge to Bridge". Then change your event and pay the remaining diffence.</p>

                    <h3>Medical</h3>
                    <p>We hope you don’t need it, but if you do there are medical tents at Justin Herman Plaza and at the After Party at Marina Green. There will also be ambulances on standby at the start and finish. If you have a medical need while out on the course, let one of the course monitors know or ask another runner to find one for you.</p>
                    <h3>Time Limit</h3>
                    <p>At 11:00 AM all walkers and runners that are still on the course will be asked to move to the sidewalk to allow the roads to be re-opened to traffic. The finish line will be open until 12 PM and the Expo will be open until 1:00 PM. Sorry no dogs, bikes, roller skates, skate boards, scooters, etc allowed on the course. <span style="font-weight:bold;">The race goes on rain or shine!</span></p>
                    <h3>Gear Check</h3>
                    <p>We will provide bags for transporting small personal items and articles of clothing only from the start area to the finish. If bringing your own bag it must be transparent and no larger than 12”x 12” x 7” and marked clearly with your bib number.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">No backpacks, large bags or containers will be transported</span></p>
